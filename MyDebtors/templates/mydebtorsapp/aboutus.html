                <p class="p2">Notify is the first online “Debt Tracker for schools” app in West Africa. We first launched on the 1st of January 2022 .

                    For 6 Months, we covered only 10 States in Nigeria . Then in July of 2022, we expanded and now we are Nationwide.
                    
                    2 months on, we have continued to deliver excellent service to our 10,000 users and counting, helping them track their debtors with simplicity and transparency. 
                    
                    Notify is on a mission 'to give every school the power to better track their debtors and manage their finances', and we intend to be the best at this. </p>
